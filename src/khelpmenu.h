 * @class KHelpMenu khelpmenu.h KHelpMenu
 *
 * @short Standard %KDE help menu with dialog boxes.
 *
 * This class provides the standard %KDE help menu with the default "about"
 * dialog boxes and help entry.
 *
 * This class is used in KMainWindow so
 * normally you don't need to use this class yourself. However, if you
 * need the help menu or any of its dialog boxes in your code that is
 * not subclassed from KMainWindow you should use this class.
 *
 * The usage is simple:
 *
 * \code
 * mHelpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this );
 * kmenubar->addMenu(mHelpMenu->menu() );
 * \endcode
 *
 * or if you just want to open a dialog box:
 *
 * \code
 * mHelpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this );
 * connect(this, &ClassFoo::someSignal, mHelpMenu, &KHelpMenu::aboutKDE);
 * \endcode
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * The first time you use KHelpMenu::menu(), a QMenu object is
 * allocated. Only one object is created by the class so if you call
 * KHelpMenu::menu() twice or more, the same pointer is returned. The class
 * will destroy the popupmenu in the destructor so do not delete this
 * pointer yourself.
 *
 * The KHelpMenu object will be deleted when its parent is destroyed but you
 * can delete it yourself if you want. The code below will always work.
 *
 * \code
 * MyClass::~MyClass()
 * {
 *   delete mHelpMenu;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * Using your own "about application" dialog box:
 *
 * The standard "about application" dialog box is quite simple. If you
 * need a dialog box with more functionality you must design that one
 * yourself. When you want to display the dialog, you simply need to
 * connect the help menu signal showAboutApplication() to your slot.
 *
 * \code
 * void MyClass::myFunc()
 * {
 *   ..
 *   KHelpMenu *helpMenu = new KHelpMenu( this );
 *   connect(helpMenu, &KHelpMenu::showAboutApplication, this, &ClassFoo:myDialogSlot);
 *   ..
 * }
 *
 * void MyClass::myDialogSlot()
 * {
 *   <activate your custom dialog>
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \image html khelpmenu.png "KHelpMenu"
 *
 * KHelpMenu respects Kiosk settings (see the KAuthorized namespace in the
 * KConfig framework).  In particular, system administrators can disable items
 * on this menu using some subset of the following configuration:
