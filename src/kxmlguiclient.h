     * \brief Plugs a new \a actionList with the given \a name.

     * ActionLists are a way for XMLGUI to support dynamic lists of
     * actions.  E.g. if you are writing a file manager, and there is a
     * menu file whose contents depend on the mimetype of the file that
     * is selected, then you can achieve this using ActionLists. It
     * works as follows:
     * In your xxxui.rc file (the one that you set in setXMLFile() / pass
     * to setupGUI()), you put a tag <ActionList name="xxx">.
     *
     * Example:
     * \code
     * <gui name="xxx_part" version="1">
     * <MenuBar>
     *   <Menu name="file">
     *     ...  <!-- some useful actions-->
     *     <ActionList name="xxx_file_actionlist" />
     *     ...  <!-- even more useful actions-->
     *   </Menu>
     *   ...
     * </MenuBar>
     * </gui>
     * \endcode
     *
     * This tag will get expanded to a list of actions.  In the example
     * above ( a file manager with a dynamic file menu ), you would call:
     *
     * \code
     * QList<QAction*> file_actions;
     * for( ... )
     *   if( ... )
     *     file_actions.append( cool_action );
     * unplugActionList( "xxx_file_actionlist" );
     * plugActionList( "xxx_file_actionlist", file_actions );
     * \endcode
     *
     * Every time a file is selected, unselected or ...
     *
     * \note You should not call KXmlGuiWindow::createGUI() after calling this
     *       function.  In fact, that would remove the newly added
     *       actionlists again...
     * \note Forgetting to call unplugActionList() before
     *       plugActionList() would leave the previous actions in the
     *       menu too..
